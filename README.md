# AFL
This project explores three AFL datasets—players, games, and game statistics—to uncover trends and insights using Python-based data analysis and visualization techniques. From tracking individual player performance over time to analyzing scoring consistency and positional impact, the project demonstrates the power of sports analytics in enhancing our understanding of Australian Rules Football.

Using tools such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn, we performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), applied moving averages, and built regression models to visualize player progression and performance metrics. Key insights were visualized through clean, intuitive plots that make the data accessible to a wide range of audiences—from analysts and commentators to coaches and passionate fans.

This repository highlights how data can be used not just to interpret past performances, but to inform future decisions and deepen engagement with the game. As the role of analytics in sports continues to grow, this project serves as a stepping stone toward more data-driven storytelling and strategy in AFL.
